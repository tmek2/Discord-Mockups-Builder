/* The canvas: grabbing it, throwing it, and zooming it.
 *
 * A preview you can only reach with a scrollbar is a picture behind glass. The
 * canvas here is grabbed and moved the way the thing it is showing would be,
 * which means three things have to be true.
 *
 * It tracks one-to-one. While the pointer is down the canvas is exactly where
 * the pointer put it, with no smoothing and no threshold once the drag has
 * started — anything else and the hand and the canvas are in different places.
 *
 * A release throws it. The scroll continues at the velocity the hand had, and
 * decays; there is no seam where the drag stops and the animation starts,
 * because the animation starts at the drag's own speed.
 *
 * A throw can be caught. Putting the pointer down during the deceleration
 * stops it dead at wherever it is on screen, which is what happens when you
 * put a hand on something sliding across a table.
 *
 * Native wheel and trackpad scrolling are left completely alone. They are
 * already good, and replacing them would be replacing something that works
 * with something that has to be maintained.
