/* Making a mockup read like a conversation that happened over time.

 * counter that adds a minute per message looks as artificial as one that adds
 * nothing.
 *
 * So: messages come in small bursts, and the clock moves between bursts. The
 * default burst is three, which is roughly how many messages a person sends
 * before someone answers.
