 *
 * The random half comes from `crypto.getRandomValues`, never `Math.random`.
 * Share ids in particular are the only thing standing between a link and
 * somebody else's mockup, and `Math.random` is seeded predictably enough in
 * some engines to enumerate.
 *
 * Ids are generated in the browser as well as on the server, so this runs in
 * both. `crypto` is a global in Node 18+ and in every browser that can run
 * this app; there is no fallback, because a fallback here would be a weaker
 * one used silently.
