# Design sources

Two design systems meet in this app, and they are kept deliberately separate.

The **editor** is Gator. It uses the same tokens, type, controls and appearance
system as the 2026 landing page on gatorsys.xyz, so the tool around the mockup
reads as part of the same product.

The **canvas** is Discord, and only Discord. Nothing from the Gator palette
reaches inside it. A mockup that is 90% accurate is a mockup somebody has to
apologise for, so the surface is built from the client's own values rather than
from an approximation of them.

## The Discord surface

- **Colour tokens.** `src/discord/tokens.css` holds the resolved chat, surface,
  text, mention, border and control colours for all four appearances, taken
  from the theme definitions in the public desktop client (checked 5 September
  2026). Discord names them internally: Ash is `theme-dark`, Dark is
  `theme-darker`, Onyx is `theme-midnight`. Every value is written through
  `--saturation-factor`, which is Discord's own hook for the accessibility
  setting that desaturates the client — it is left at 1 here, but the tokens
  are shaped so the control could be exposed without touching a colour.
- **Component anatomy.** Discord's component reference
  (<https://docs.discord.com/developers/components/reference>) for containers,
  sections, text displays, media galleries, files, separators, action rows and
  the five select-menu types, along with the limits shown as counters in the
  editor.
- **Appearance names.** Discord's own support article on colour themes, for the
  Light / Ash / Dark / Onyx naming.
- **Community kits inspected**, for structure rather than for values:
  [skyra-project/discord-components](https://github.com/skyra-project/discord-components)
  and [BF-GO/discord-message-kit](https://github.com/BF-GO/discord-message-kit).
  Both still carry the pre-2024 palette, where the chat ground was `#36393f`
  and an embed was a flat dark grey, so neither was copied.
- **Emoji.** Discord ships Twemoji rather than using the platform's emoji font,
  which is why a message looks identical on every operating system inside the
  client. The same asset set is used here, from the maintained fork
  ([jdecked/twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji)) over jsDelivr, pinned
  to a version rather than to `latest` so an upstream release cannot change a
  mockup that has already been exported. If the CDN cannot be reached the
  renderer falls back to the character itself.

### Measured layout values

40px avatars; a 56px inset from the avatar's left edge to the message body;
16px content at a 1.375 line height; 12px timestamps on a 22px header line; a
17px gap above a new message and 0 above a grouped one; a 4px accent on an
embed at a 4px radius and an 8px one on a container; 8px between embed fields;
a twelve-column field grid, so two inline fields on a row take six columns each
rather than four; 16px above embed media.

Discord publishes no pixel-perfect specification for every client state. These
sources establish concrete reference values; they do not prove that every
possible mockup matches every rollout, operating system, density setting or
feature flag. This is a visual editor, not the Discord client, and custom
spacing and mixed content stay intentionally editable.

## Performance

Two things were making a large mockup heavier than it needed to be, and both
were measured rather than guessed.

**Images.** The icon library is 125 tiles, and a canvas draws forty of them at
a time. Separately that is 125 requests, 125 decodes and 125 GPU textures for
artwork that never changes; as one atlas it is one of each, 46KB, cached for a
year. The atlas is preloaded so it is in flight with the document rather than
after the stylesheet has been parsed, and the Twemoji CDN is preconnected so
the first emoji a mockup draws is not also a DNS lookup and a TLS handshake.
Emoji decode off the main thread and load lazily; so do the 240 avatars in the
picker.

The trade-off in a CSS mask is real — [Cloud Four's stress
test](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/svg-icon-stress-test/) found masking the
slowest of the icon techniques at a thousand icons on one page. That is not
this: forty glyphs at a time, and the alternative is baking a copy of every
icon per colour state, which loses the hover and the destructive red. One
decoded atlas serving all of them is the cheaper end of that trade.

**Typing.** A keystroke in the content field re-parsed the markdown of every
message on the canvas. Three things caused it: each row was handed a freshly
constructed click closure, the render context carried the whole message list so
any edit invalidated every consumer, and the row was not memoised. All three
are fixed — one handler for the stream that reads the id off the row, replies
resolved on the way past instead of out of context, and `memo` on the row. In
a Chrome CPU profile the markdown parser was 11.7% of samples during a typing
burst and is now absent from it. Script time per keystroke, measured through
the DevTools protocol rather than a wall clock:

| messages on canvas | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 40 | 8.8 ms | 5.0 ms |
| 150 | 22.5 ms | 7.1 ms |

## The editor

- **Tokens, appearance, header and controls** are ported from the 2026 landing
  page in the `gatorsys.xyz` repository (`src/components/landing2`): the
  palette, the two-appearance system with its three settings, the travelling
  nav blob, the cycling appearance block with its view-transition wipe, the
  ripple button and the hover label.
- **The block tree** follows the message designer in the Gator dashboard
  (`src/components/Manage/message-design.tsx`): the same add / nest / collapse /
  duplicate / reorder grammar and the same rule that a container is a block like
  any other rather than a wrapper around everything. What is missing is
  deliberate — the dashboard wires a button to a ticket panel, a form or a flow
  because a bot has to run it. Here a button is a label, a colour and an emoji.
  Nothing in this app sends anything.

## Icons

Every glyph the canvas draws — the composer buttons, the message action bar,
the channel hashes, the system-message arrows, the profile badges, the status
dots and the server tags — is Discord's own artwork, from the community
Ultimate Discord Library PSD supplied with the project. Nothing on the canvas
is a hand-drawn path or an emoji standing in for an icon: an approximated GIF
button is exactly the tell that gives a mockup away.

They live in `public/discord/` as PNGs and are drawn through
`src/discord/icon.jsx`. Monochrome ones are painted with a CSS mask so
`currentColor` reaches them, which is what lets one file serve the muted state
of a composer button, the white of a hovered one and the red of a destructive
menu row. The handful whose colour is the artwork — a ban hammer, a GIF badge,
the blurple checkbox — are drawn as images instead, and `icon.jsx` keeps the
list.

Extracting them was not a straight export. Each layer in the PSD is a tile of
artwork flattened onto a flat `#262732` swatch with a fully opaque alpha
channel, so a naive read gives 32×32 dark squares that look right only against
a background of the same colour. The shape lives in the luminance instead, and
the recovery inverts the composite: the swatch is identified by its known
colour rather than by frequency (a glyph that runs to the tile edge owns most
of the border), a monochrome glyph is reconstructed from the single ink of its
most distant pixel — exact, so solid interiors come back fully opaque and only
the antialiased rim is fractional — and a multi-coloured badge is treated as
solid beyond a threshold with the colour un-multiplied back out.

## Type

Discord's face is gg sans, which is licensed to Discord and cannot be
redistributed with a deployment. The canvas is set in **Inter** (SIL Open Font
License, via Google Fonts): the same humanist grotesque skeleton, the same tall
x-height, and metrics near enough that a message wraps where the client wraps
it. Noto Sans follows it in the stack because that is the fallback Discord's
own stylesheet names.

The editor is set in **Nunito**, with **Merriweather** for display type — the
two faces the rest of Gator uses.

## Avatars

The 240 default avatars in `public/avatars` are drawn from the collection
supplied with the project, at their original 45px artwork bounds. They are
files rather than base64 inlined into a module, so the browser fetches only the
ones it draws and the picker can lazy-load.
